### ABSTRACT

As urban traffic congestion continues to escalate, so does the proliferation of buses in these areas. Our proposed solution aims to create a seamless public transport experience for all stakeholders.
On the user front, a web application will be developed to provide real-time bus locations along chosen routes, enhancing convenience. Utilizing GPS on each bus and the WebSocket protocol for data transmission, the application will display live bus locations alongside Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA). The GPS device will be able communicate with the application server using an intermediate WebSocket Server cum SocketIO Client. We aim at developing this API so as to capitalise on the benefits of SocketIO library of the JavaScript despite of embedded devices. 
The system eliminates the need for users to memorize bus numbers, making public transport easily accessible for tourists and non-residents who might otherwise be deterred by a lack of information. Regular commuters, who traditionally wait for their buses to arrive, without real-time information, will now have the current bus location and ETA at their fingertips, allowing them to plan their travels more efficiently. 
With over 2200 buses operated by Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML), safety and emergency management are paramount. By implementing advanced emergency systems, the transport company can enhance operational scalability, ensuring a safer and more efficient public transport system.
The project prioritizes user trust and aims to streamline emergency responses. Drivers will have a user-friendly option to manually notify the emergency department with a single button press. In critical situations, the system can automatically detect emergencies and promptly alert the necessary authorities.
Additionally, the project focuses on providing a seamless experience for bus drivers, minimizing technical complexities. Bus registration into the system merely requires installing the designated device and entering the travel route. This process is facilitated by a custom-built graph database, enabling effortless insertion and deletion of buses and associated routes. Custom routes can also be configured by buses during the database insertion process.
